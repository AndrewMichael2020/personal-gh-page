# GitHub Copilot Build Brief — Personal Site  (Jekyll Pages)
_Last updated: 2025-09-08T15:20:13Z_

**Goal**: Use **GitHub Copilot** to scaffold a GitHub Pages site (Jekyll) that renders the exact content below as a single-page website with anchor-linked sections and a portrait photo. The site should open with the headline and “Executive summary” section at the top. Do **not** edit the wording of the provided text.

---
Pages type: personal page that shows professional strengths, big potential, continuous learning, and tech and some managerial stacks (although emphasis is on tech, as it is more important and more difficult to acquire).
Repo: https://github.com/AndrewMichael2020/personal-gh-page
Pages: should include AndrewMichael2020

## Executive summary
I design and deliver secure, production-grade data platforms and real-time analytics that scale across enterprise environments. I partner with clinical, operations and executive stakeholders to turn high-volume sources into trusted metrics, automated workflows, and deployable systems — with governance, observability and measurable business impact. I lead cross-discipline delivery from prototype to CI/CD production and harden systems for compliance and reliability.

## Core strengths

Platform architecture & data engineering: ingestion, lakehouse/warehouse design, partitioning, clustering, performant semantic models.

Real-time operational analytics: streaming ingestion → lightweight compute → alerts and live tiles; SLA design and backpressure controls.

Security & governance: Entra ID, least-privilege patterns, row-level security, dynamic masking, audit trails and secure secret handling.

BI & visualization leadership: executive & shift dashboards, KPI hierarchies, drill paths, and operational handoffs.

ML & agentic AI delivery: batch & real-time ML pipelines, pragmatic RAG/vector deployments, speech→text pipelines and controlled agent prototypes.

Delivery & reliability: reproducible CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments, runbooks, observability and post-deploy SLAs.

## Selected impact examples

Semantic model + BI layer — Replaced ad-hoc manual reporting with a semantic model and Power BI layer, automating recurring reports and reducing incoming manual report requests to the analytics team by an estimated ~80%, freeing analysts for higher-value work.

Real-time operations — Built a Pub/Sub → Cloud Run → BigQuery streaming pipeline and an executive cockpit in Power BI that moved bed-management reporting from daily batches to near-real-time dashboards, resulting in an estimated ~60% faster detection and resolution of capacity issues.

Synthetic data & safe sandboxes — Delivered privacy-safe analytics sandboxes and localized synthetic cohort generators to enable model development and validation in days rather than weeks, producing an estimated ~70% reduction in model dev/validation cycle time while preserving PHI residency and auditability.

CI/CD & release reproducibility — Implemented reproducible CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and hardened container images to standardize releases and recovery procedures, improving release predictability and reducing emergency hotfix events by an estimated ~65%.

Agentic AI & tool orchestration — Built agentic AI prototypes and LangGraph/LangChain-style orchestrations that automated document retrieval, triage and task orchestration for analysts, reducing manual query and triage time by an estimated ~50%.

## What I bring to a team

Outcome orientation: I focus on measurable business KPIs, clear SLAs, and demonstrable ROI for analytics investments.

Cross-functional leadership: I translate executive needs into technical roadmaps and mentor engineers to deliver reliable systems.

Compliance-first engineering: designs that meet privacy, residency and audit requirements while remaining pragmatic for delivery.

Rapid prototyping to production: proof-of-value in weeks, production hardening in months.

## Roles & engagements I’m targeting

Senior / Lead Data Solutions Engineer

Data Platforms Engineering Lead / Head of Data Platforms

Principal Data Engineer (real-time + security focus)
Open to senior roles in healthcare and non-health sectors; remote / hybrid / Vancouver-based.

## Core technologies (concise)
Power BI · KQL/ADX · Python · SQL (T-SQL) · FastAPI · Cloud Run / GCP · Pub/Sub · BigQuery · GitHub Actions · Docker · Kubernetes · Azure (Fabric, App Service, Azure SQL, Entra ID) · Row-level security · Dynamic masking · Vector search · Whisper/STT · TensorFlow/Keras · LangChain/LangGraph

## Hiring signals I look for

Leadership remit over data platform or analytics products.

Clear ownership for delivery, governance and SLAs.

Teams ready to adopt CI/CD, observability and security practices.

Budget and executive sponsorship for operational analytics / ML initiatives.

## Next step
