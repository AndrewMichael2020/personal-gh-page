I design and deliver secure, production-grade data platforms that scale across enterprise environments. I partner with operations and executive stakeholders to turn high-volume data into data-powered applications, intelligent workflows, deployable systems, and beautiful, responsive visualizations â€” with governance, full observability, and measurably high business impact. I lead cross-discipline delivery from prototype to continuous integration and continuous delivery production, and harden systems for regulatory compliance and operational resilience.
