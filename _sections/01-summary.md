I am designing and shipping secure data platforms, governed semantic models, and decision‑ready dashboards. I am collaborating with stakeholders to define KPIs and metric rules, implementing SQL and data contracts, and—when required—adding APIs, ML integrations, and deployment automation. Focus: Azure first, with GCP exposure.
