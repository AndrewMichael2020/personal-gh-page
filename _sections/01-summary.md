I am building data-intensive services and products that encode business logic as APIs and decision tools. I am designing stable schemas and API interfaces, integrating ML and agentic workflows when required, and adding CI/CD and observability as needed. I am also producing presentation-ready visuals and lightweight UIs when they serve the product. Primary Azure, with  GCP exposure.
