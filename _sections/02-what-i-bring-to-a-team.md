* **Outcome orientation**: I am aligning work to defined KPIs and SLAs, mapping KPI trees to data sources, setting success criteria and SLOs, and closing the loop with written recommendations and measured deltas; I am documenting metric rules and data contracts so results are repeatable and auditable.

* **Metrics and scorecards**: I am owning metric definitions and weekly/quarterly scorecards end to endâ€”backlog, UAT, release notes, and change logs; I am publishing role-specific dashboards in Power BI and Looker with drill paths and freshness and latency notes, and I am running stakeholder reviews to ensure decisions follow from the numbers.

* **Data quality SLAs (when required)**: I am defining freshness, completeness, and accuracy checks with thresholds and owners, wiring breach alerts to channels on duty, tracking MTTR for data issues, and writing concise incident summaries with corrective and preventive actions.

* **Cost and performance (when required)**: I am setting budgets/SLOs per workload, profiling queries (indexes, partitions, caching, and query plans), right-sizing jobs, and pruning unused artifacts; I am reporting cost-to-value and proposing de-scoping or consolidation when ROI is weak.

* **Team leadership and mentorship**: I am mentoring analysts and engineers via code/design reviews, pairing, and short learning sessions; I am running delivery cadences (planning, demos, retros), unblocking cross-team dependencies, and keeping standards consistent with lightweight ADRs and checklists.

* **Knowledge management and transfer**: I am maintaining a concise docs hub, ADRs, and how-to notes; I am recording decisions and handoffs so context persists across rotations, and I am running office hours for shared components.

* **Requirements and analysis (when required)**: I am eliciting requirements through interviews and workshops, writing user stories and acceptance criteria, and maintaining lightweight PRDs and sequence/context diagrams to keep scope clear across the SDLC and product lifecycle.

* **Agentic AI delivery**: I am building retrieval-augmented and tool-using workflows grounded on enterprise data and exposing capabilities through APIs; I am using frameworks like LangGraph, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, CrewAI, and BeeAI, and platform tools from Google (Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Vertex AI) and Microsoft (Azure OpenAI, function calling, MCP fundamentals). I am integrating evaluation and guardrails by maintaining golden test sets and rubric-based checks, tracing requests and responses, running canary/A-B validations, and applying input/output filtering, prompt-injection defenses, PII redaction, tool allow/deny policies, rate limits, and secure secrets handling.

* **Governance (when required)**: I am implementing RBAC/RLS, lineage, auditable changes, and documented definitions to meet privacy, residency, and audit needs.

* **Cross-functional delivery**: I am translating leadership goals into technical roadmaps, shaping source data into governed semantic models, and presenting decision-oriented dashboards in Power BI and Looker.

* **Data and APIs**: I am implementing SQL for metric definitions, time windows, and quality checks on platforms like Azure SQL, Microsoft Fabric, and BigQuery; I am exposing business logic through APIs when needed.

* **Software development practices**: I am writing maintainable Python, C#, C, and C++ with tests and docstrings, using design reviews, lightweight ADRs, and API contracts to keep changes predictable.

* **Git and GitHub**: I am maintaining branch protection, Codeowners files, required reviews, and environment protections/approvals; I am using pull requests with checklists and ADR links so changes stay traceable.

* **GitHub Actions **: I am building workflows for tests, linting, packaging, and gated deploys (matrix builds, environments, OIDC to Azure/GCP), with reusable workflow templates for consistency.

* **GitHub Advanced Security (when required)**: I am enabling Dependabot, secret scanning, and CodeQL; I am triaging findings, pinning versions, and adding mitigations and exceptions with documented rationale.

* **Prototyping to production**: I am turning prototypes into shippable features by defining data contracts and KPIs early, adding tests and observability, and standardizing releases and runbooks.

* **Operational reliability (when required)**: I am introducing automated checks and monitored releases using toolsets like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or Cloud Build, and I am supporting Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment with clear promotion gates.

* **Monitoring and observability**: I am instrumenting services and datasets with logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and error budgets; I am surfacing health and data-quality signals to stakeholders using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitor/Application Insights, and Google Cloud Monitoring, and (when required) integrating Microsoft Sentinel for security signals and Microsoft Purview for lineage/classification.

* **Platform security awareness**: I am applying least-privilege access, secrets management, hardened images, OWASP-aware reviews, and dependency hygiene.

* **Networking (cloud)**: I am deploying with VNet/VPC fundamentals (subnets, security groups/NSGs, private endpoints/Private Link, peering, DNS, load balancers) so apps stay least-exposed and reliably reachable.

* **Change control**: I am versioning schemas and metric definitions, adding deprecation notices, and coordinating changes across producers and consumers.

* **Incident readiness (when required)**: I am keeping runbooks, on-call notes, and post-incident reviews so fixes are fast and repeatable; I am maintaining tested backup and restore steps.

* **Accessibility and exports**: I am ensuring accessible visuals, printable layouts, and stable CSV and interoperable exports for downstream use.
