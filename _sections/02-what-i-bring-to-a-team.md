* **Outcome orientation**: I focus on measurable business KPIs, clear SLAs, and demonstrable ROI for analytics investments.
* **Cross-functional leadership**: I translate executive needs into technical roadmaps and mentor engineers to deliver reliable systems.
* **Compliance-first engineering**: designs that meet privacy, residency and audit requirements while remaining pragmatic for delivery.
* **Rapid prototyping to production**: proof-of-value in weeks, production hardening in months.
