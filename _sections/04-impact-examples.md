### Semantic Model + BI Layer
Replaced ad-hoc manual reporting with a semantic model and Power BI layer, automating recurring reports and reducing manual report requests by consolidating metrics and scheduling outputs.

### Streaming Operations
Built a Pub/Sub → Cloud Run → BigQuery streaming pipeline and an executive cockpit in Power BI that moved bed-management reporting from daily batches to timely dashboards, resulting in faster detection by moving from daily batch checks to timely updates with alerts.

### Synthetic Data & Safe Sandboxes
Delivered privacy-safe analytics sandboxes and localized synthetic cohort generators to enable model development and validation in days rather than weeks, while preserving PHI residency and auditability.

### CI/CD & Release Reproducibility
Implemented reproducible CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and hardened container images to standardize releases and recovery procedures, resulting in fewer emergency hotfixes after standardizing release steps.

### Agentic AI & Tool Orchestration
Built agentic AI prototypes and LangGraph/LangChain-style orchestrations that automated document retrieval, triage and task orchestration for analysts, resulting in less manual triage after documenting KPIs and validation checks.
