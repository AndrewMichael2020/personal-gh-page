### Semantic Model + BI Layer
Replaced ad-hoc manual reporting with a semantic model and Power BI layer, automating recurring reports and reducing incoming manual report requests to the analytics team by an estimated ~80%, freeing analysts for higher-value work.

### Real-time Operations
Built a Pub/Sub → Cloud Run → BigQuery streaming pipeline and an executive cockpit in Power BI that moved bed-management reporting from daily batches to near-real-time dashboards, resulting in an estimated ~60% faster detection and resolution of capacity issues.

### Synthetic Data & Safe Sandboxes
Delivered privacy-safe analytics sandboxes and localized synthetic cohort generators to enable model development and validation in days rather than weeks, producing an estimated ~70% reduction in model dev/validation cycle time while preserving PHI residency and auditability.

### CI/CD & Release Reproducibility
Implemented reproducible CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and hardened container images to standardize releases and recovery procedures, improving release predictability and reducing emergency hotfix events by an estimated ~65%.

### Agentic AI & Tool Orchestration
Built agentic AI prototypes and LangGraph/LangChain-style orchestrations that automated document retrieval, triage and task orchestration for analysts, reducing manual query and triage time by an estimated ~50%.
