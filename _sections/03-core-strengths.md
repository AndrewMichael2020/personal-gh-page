## Data Platform & Engineering
* Ingest and normalize from databases, files, APIs, and streaming sources.
* Lakehouse/warehouse design partitioning, clustering, indexing, access controls.
* Contract-driven schemas (DDL + data contracts), schema registry, reproducible backfills.
* Performance tuning columnar formats, cost controls, query plans, caching strategies.

## CI/CD & Reliability Engineering
* Build/test/release pipelines for data + services (GitHub Actions), artifact versioning, promotion gates.
* Blue/green and canary deploys for services; rollback playbooks; environment parity (DevContainers, Codespaces, etc.).
* Observability structured logs, metrics, traces; SLOs/SLAs and error budgets for data products.
* IaC for repeatable environments; runbooks and on-call procedures.

## Real-time & Streaming Analytics
* Streaming ingestion → lightweight compute → real-time tiles/alerts.
* Backpressure, retry, and idempotency patterns; exactly-once or effectively-once delivery where required.
* Operational diagnostics (KQL/notebooks), drill paths, and on-call handoffs.

## Agentic AI & Automation
* LangGraph/AG2/CrewAI orchestrations tool use, retrieval, and multi-step workflows with deterministic state machines.
* Policy-guarded agents with audit logs, data-access boundaries, and prompt/response evaluation harnesses.
* Batch & real-time ML integration feature extraction, scoring endpoints, monitoring for drift/latency.

## Security & Governance
* Access controls row-level security, dynamic masking, tokenization.
* Secrets management, key rotation, least-privilege patterns; tamper-evident audit trails.
* Data lineage, change logs, and compliance-ready documentation.

## BI & Visualization
* Executive and shift-level dashboards with KPI hierarchies and drill-throughs.
* Semantic models for self-service; printable exports and performance-optimized visuals.
* Documentation training decks, operational runbooks, training videos.
