# Personal GitHub Page

This repository hosts a personal website implemented with GitHub Pages.  

## Implementation Details

- The site uses **GitHub Pages** with Jekyll-based static site generation, structured with custom `_layouts` and `_sections` for theme and layout control.  
- A centralized `_config.yml` file provides declarative configuration for site-wide settings and consistent builds.  
- Static resources are organized under `assets/images`, enabling clean management of images and other assets.  
- The main entry point is `index.html` at the root, which handles navigation and routing for a lightweight homepage.  
- Deployment is automated: pushing changes to the `main` branch triggers GitHub Pages to rebuild and publish the site live.
