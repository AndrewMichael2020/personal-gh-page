- title: Data platform &amp; engineering
  bullets:
    - Ingest and normalize from databases, files, APIs, and streaming sources.
    - Lakehouse/warehouse design partitioning, clustering, indexing, access controls.
    - Contract-driven schemas (DDL + data contracts), schema registry, reproducible backfills.
    - Performance tuning columnar formats, cost controls, query plans, caching strategies.

- title: CI/CD &amp; reliability engineering
  bullets:
    - Build/test/release pipelines for data + services (GitHub Actions), artifact versioning, promotion gates.
    - Blue/green and canary deploys for services; rollback playbooks; environment parity (DevContainers, Codespaces, etc.).
    - Observability structured logs, metrics, traces; SLOs/SLAs and error budgets for data products.
    - IaC for repeatable environments; runbooks and on-call procedures.

- title: Real-time &amp; streaming analytics
  bullets:
    - Streaming ingestion → lightweight compute → real-time tiles/alerts.
    - Backpressure, retry, and idempotency patterns; exactly-once or effectively-once delivery where required.

  bullets:
    - LangGraph/AG2/CrewAI orchestrations tool use, retrieval, and multi-step workflows with deterministic state machines.
    - Policy-guarded agents with audit logs, data-access boundaries, and prompt/response evaluation harnesses.
    - Batch &amp; real-time ML integration feature extraction, scoring endpoints, monitoring for drift/latency.

- title: Security &amp; governance
  bullets:
    - Access controls row-level security, dynamic masking, tokenization.
    - Secrets management, key rotation, least-privilege patterns; tamper-evident audit trails.
    - Data lineage, change logs, and compliance-ready documentation.

- title: BI &amp; visualization
  bullets:
    - Executive and shift-level dashboards with KPI hierarchies and drill-throughs.
    - Semantic models for self-service; printable exports and performance-optimized visuals.
    - Documentation training decks, operational runbooks, training videos.
